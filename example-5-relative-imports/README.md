# Relative imports

## Example 1
What happens when you want to import a stdlib module, but there's another module in the same directory?

```python
python example_1.py
```

## Example 2
What happens when you try to import a module from your current directory, but the `PYTHONPATH` makes other take precedence?

```python
python example_2.py
```

```python
python example_3.py
```
